What does pack() do?

    'Compute a rectangular area called a parcel thatâ€™s just tall (or wide) enough to hold the widget and fills the
    remaining width (or height) in the window with blank space.
    Center the widget in the parcel unless a different location is specified.'
    Places widgets in the order they're packed, from top to bottom.
